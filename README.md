# Event-Driven Activity & Notification Platform

A scalable backend platform designed to process user activities asynchronously using event-driven architecture.

This system demonstrates:
- Kafka-based event processing
- Redis caching strategies
- GraphQL API gateway
- PostgreSQL relational modeling
- Horizontal scalability design

## Problem statement:

Modern applications require real-time activity processing, notification systems, and feed aggregation at scale. 
Synchronous processing tightly couples components and increases latency. 
This project explores an event-driven architecture to decouple activity ingestion from downstream processing, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance.
